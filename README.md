# Weather Dashboard

Launch site: https://cmanthou.github.io/6.Weather-Dashboard/

Using Javascript, JQuery and the Open Weather API a travel weather dashboard was created.  Multiple cities can be entered on the page and those city's current weather and 5-day forcasts will be pulled from the API and displayed.  The cities will be saved in Local Storage so the can be returned to as needed.

The Open Weather Map (https://openweathermap.org/api) API, Bootstrap (https://getbootsrap.com/) CSS code and the Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/) library were utilized in writing this code.

Open Weather Map API KEY = 4ba768620ca0d5bb027a16274e4f792d

NOTES:  I tried to add a 'clear city' button to remove the cities from local storage, but ran out of time to complete it.  I also tried to encorporate the background image I have utalized in all of my homeworks for continuety, but it did not look great in my page format, so I ended up not using it.
